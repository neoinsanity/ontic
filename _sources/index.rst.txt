Ontic - Of or Relating to Entities and the Facts about Them
=============================================================

**Ontic** is an object definition tool. **Ontic** provides schema definition of
object types that are accessible as a class instance or as a dictionary.
**Ontic** also provides the tools to validate and perfect type instances.

To that end **Ontic** objects can be accessed through attribute access or via
dictionary key access. The theory is that most third party libraries, from JSON
to NoSql packages, take some form of the dict as input. Attribute access is
easier to type when writing code, hence the attribute access. By way of
example::

  >>> an_object = ontic.ontic_type.OnticType()
  >>> an_object['property1'] = 1
  >>> assert an_object.property1 == 1
  >>> an_object.property2 = 2
  >>> assert an_object['property2] == 2
  >>> json.dumps(an_object)  # an_object implements dict interface.
    '{"property1": 1, "property2": 2}'

As **Ontic** objects are designed to be utilized as pure data objects, they
implement the python *dict* interface. So anywhere you can use or pass a dict
object, you can pass an **Ontic** object. **Ontic** objects can even be
initialized like a dictionary, as exampled below::

  >>> an_object = ontic.ontic_type.OnticType({'the_property':'the_value'})
  >>> assert an_object.the_property = 'the_value'
  >>> assert an_object['the_property'] = 'the_value'

In addition **Ontic** provides schema and validation features to aid in working
with data representations. Schemas and corresponding types can be generated
at runtime, or types can be defined as classes that derive from the **Ontic**
*OnticType*. Here's some quick examples::

  Class definition of an Ontic type with schema.
  >>> from ontic.ontic_type import OnticType
  >>> from ontic_schema_type import SchemaType
  >>> class MyType(OnticType):
  ...   ONTIC_SCHEMA = SchemaType({'the_property':{'required':True}})
  >>> my_object = MyType()
  >>> ontic.ontic_type.validate_object(my_object)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "ontic/ontic_type.py", line 137, in validate_object
        raise ValidationException(str.join(' \n-- ', value_errors))
    ValidationException: The value for "the_property" is required.
  >>> my_object.the_property = 99
  >>> ontic.ontic_type.validate_object(my_object)

and dynamic definition of Ontic type with schema.

  >>> my_type = ontic.ontic_type.create_ontic_type(
  ...   'MyType', {'the_property':{'required':True}})
  >>> my_object = my_type()
  >>> ontic.ontic_type.validate_object(my_object)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "ontic/ontic_type.py", line 137, in validate_object
        raise ValueError(str.join(' \n-- ', value_errors))
    ValidationException: The value for "the_property" is required.
  >>> my_object['the_property'] = 'Some value'
  >>> ontic.ontic_type.validate_object(my_object)
